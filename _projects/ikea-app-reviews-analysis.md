In the ReDI School's Data Analytics Course project, I analyzed IKEA app reviews from Google Play Store. I cleaned the data, then used a correlation matrix and linear regression to explore the impact of app versions on review sentiment scores. This approach not only allowed for the identification of subtle but significant trends in user feedback but also exemplified the application of statistical methods in deriving actionable insights from real-world data.
