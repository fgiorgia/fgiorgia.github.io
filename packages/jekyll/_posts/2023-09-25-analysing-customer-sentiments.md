## Background

For the first assignment in the Introduction to Data Analytics Course at the ReDI School MalmÃ¶, we were tasked with a fascinating project: analyze customer feedback for a fictional startup in the natural beauty sector. The goal was to use data analytics to understand customers' perceptions of products and services, simulating real-world business analytics practices.

## Insights & Impact

With data from 71 responses, the analysis dove deep into understanding customer demographics, satisfaction levels, and open-ended feedback. Key findings included:

* A diverse age distribution indicating the brandâ€™s broad appeal.
* Product and service ratings highlighted strengths and areas for improvement, with an overall positive inclination towards recommending the brand.
* Feedback analysis brought to light common themes such as eco-friendliness and product diversity, directing attention to potential strategic improvements.

        Half of the people said the products didnâ€™t work as they hoped, and some even had bad reactions like redness. They also wished for more choices and longer-lasting items. To make things better, the brand could change up their formulas and make sure quality is top-notch. Plus, they should make it easier to talk to customer service. A good sign is that most customers would tell their friends about the products, showing they really believe in them. By fixing these issues and keeping up the good work, the brand looks set to do well.
